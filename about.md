About Me - Gart Turian

My online name is. I am an expat living in Taiwan. Although I am retired, I still enjoy teaching English to a small number of carefully sellected students. My one-on-one interactions with them give me feelings of great satifaction. Their willingness to work so hard inspires me.
This is dedicated to them.
