<h2>The Wolf Wilder</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>     Fedora lives with her mother. Their house is in the snowy woods of Russia. Feo's mother is a wolf wilder. She teaches wolves to become wild animals again. Those wolves were once the pets of rich Russians. They are tame like dogs now and can't take care of themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Feo is learning to be a wolf wilder. Her best friends are their wolves. white, gray, and black. She loves helping her mother and the wolves. Although it can sometimes be dangerous. Her life changes when General Rakoff arrives at their front door.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     He orders them to stop making wolves wild. The wolves are eating all the animals. However, Feo and her mother won't obey. Rakoff leaves but then he comes back and he takes Feo’s mother away and burns their house down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Fedora wants to save her mother. She doesn't know where she is, though. Then, a young soldier, Ilya, tells her the news. General Rakoff sent her mother to a prison in St. Petersburg. Ilya is kind and offers to take Feo there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     The two of them come up with a plan of action; they prepare food, water, and some things for fighting. Soon, Feo and Ilya, and her three wolves start their difficult journey. However, Rakoff finds out about their plans and he follows them and tries to catch them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     That doesn't stop Feo because she isn't afraid to fight back. Finally, she gets to St. Petersburg, but her journey is not over. The young wolf wilder still has one more job to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Fedora and Ilya arrived in St. Petersburg with the wolves. The city was cold and busy, and they had to be careful. General Rakoff’s soldiers were looking for them, but Feo was determined to save her mother. She whispered to the wolves, “Stay close and stay quiet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     They found the prison where her mother was kept. It was big and surrounded by guards. Feo didn’t know how to get inside, but Ilya had a plan. He would distract the guards and Feo and the wolves would sneak in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Ilya walked up to the guards and started talking. He acted like a lost soldier asking for directions. While the guards were distracted, Feo and the wolves quietly climbed over the back wall. Once inside, they looked for her mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Suddenly, they heard a soft voice. “Feo!” It was her mother! She was locked in a small room. Feo found the keys on a table nearby. She opened the door, and they hugged.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Just then, Rakoff appeared. “Stop them!” he shouted. But the wolves growled and stood in front of Feo and her mother, ready to protect them. Rakoff was scared of the wolves and backed away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     Together, Feo, her mother, Ilya, and the wolves ran out of the prison. They quickly escaped into the snowy woods. They were finally free.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>     As they walked back home, Feo smiled. She knew that with her wolves and her new friends, she could face any challenge. She was a true wolf wilder now.</p>
